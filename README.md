Social Media Analytics - Final Project


As part of the Social Media Analytics course at Yale, we are attempting to understand how misinformation spreads on Social Media. We chose the topics "Ghost of Kyiv" and "Snake Island" (both stories that have been debunked since). 

Using Python (locally using Jupyter Notebook and on the cloud using Google Colabs), we have used a variety of techniques to analyze the tweets. 

This repo contains a record of the code. [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/nithin-seenivasan/twitter-analysis/blob/main/FinalProject_GOK.ipynb) to track our progress
